## Examination of Crypto Algorithms for Arduino Uno

Contributors: Ulku Meteriz & Munteha Nur Bedir

### Dependencies

* Arduino development software must be installed. (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

* Arduino Cryptology Library must be installed. (https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs/tree/master/libraries/Crypto)

* MemoryFree Library must be installed. (https://github.com/sudar/MemoryFree)


### Implementation

* We used Arduino Cryptology Library examples as a reference. (https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs/tree/master/libraries/Crypto/examples)

* We used Diffie-Hellman algorithm implementation as reference. (https://github.com/DevMomo/Diffie-Hellman-Arduino)

* Codes are written for Arduino as .ino extension.


### Testing

* Arduino Uno must be selected as connected device in Arduino Software.

* Test results are printed on serial monitor, and information about memory usage is printed on bottom of Arduino Software.
